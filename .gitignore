# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all environment files (except templates).
/env*
!/env*.erb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Allow all files under the storage directory, including databases
# Removed /storage/* so that all files in /storage will be tracked.
# Now everything in storage/ will be tracked, including the database files.

# Ignore assets and packs
/public/assets
/public/packs
/public/packs-test

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key

# Ignore node modules and yarn files
/node_modules
/yarn-error.log
yarn-debug.log*
.yarn-integrity

# Keep the SQLite database files
!/db/*.sqlite3
